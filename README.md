# Discord Fake Token Grabber
Fake Discord token grabber that is, like my other projects, free and open source for anyone to use

**Requirements:**
* Python with standard libaries (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Discord.py (https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

**Download:**
Download the 'config.txt' file, the 'start.bat' file, and finally the 'tokenGrabber.py' file

**How to use:**
1. Put your token in the first line of the 'config.txt' file and then your preferred prefix in the second
2. Open the 'start.bat' file to start up the bot
3. Turn on developer mode in settings under the 'Advanced' category
4. Get the user ID of your target (search up how)
5. Use the command '!grab [userID]'* in a server with the bot added and the bot will send you an embed with a fake token amongst other things  <br />
   
Probably won't update this, my main project will be 'JOHAN NUKER' <br />

*Your prefix may not be '!', instead use whatever prefix you put in the 'config.txt' file's second line
